# 🧬 Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

A deep learning-based system to classify skin lesions as **benign** or **malignant** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
This project aims to support early detection of skin cancer through image-based classification powered by modern AI techniques.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built in **TensorFlow/Keras** to detect skin cancer from dermoscopic images.  
The model is trained on labeled skin lesion datasets and can be used for both **training** and **real-time prediction**.
